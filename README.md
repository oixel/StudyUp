# StudyUp
StudyUp is a collaborative, educational take on the classic game "Heads Up!" <br>

# Problem Statement + Solution
Students of all levels can understand that traditional studying is oftentimes an overwhelming, dull experience. Offering methods of group studying is something that addresses this problem by offering a game-ified solution.
The countless benefits of group studying include improved understanding, increased motivation, and better memory retention. On the Education track, we hope that this app can offer users a way to have fun and *Study Up* before their next exam!

# Future Implementations + Next Steps
Ideally, we want to implement cross-platform implementation with applications such as Quizlet and Anki so that users can utilize their existing databases. Additionally, using AI to convert notes into sets can also be a great future addition.
